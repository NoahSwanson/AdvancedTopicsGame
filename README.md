At the bottom center of the screen there will be a ball.
The game will indicate with an arrow what direction the ball will start out moving in. 
The player starts out with 1 brick. The ball can destroy the bricks by hitting them. 
The goal of the game is to place the bricks in locations such that once the ball 
is released and starts moving it is able to destroy all of the bricks before it 
hits the bottom again. If the ball hits the bottom the game restarts from 1 brick. 
Your high score is kept in the top right corner of the game. 
The level you are currently on is kept in the center of the screen. 
You use your mouse to place the bricks. 
If there are two players, player one selects the bricks and player two plays picks what 
direction the game will move. Secondary objective is that after 100 bricks you unlock a new skin.
